/**
 Swiftified version of OSSpinLock.
 
 Use when the lock is taken often, contention is low, and the locked code runs quickly. It has low overhead and thus helps performance for hot code paths.
 
 Do NOT use when code may hold the lock for a substantial amount of time, or contention is common, as it will waste CPU time.
